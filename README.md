# Memory Management System

A comprehensive web-based simulation tool for understanding and visualizing memory management concepts in operating systems. This project provides interactive demonstrations of dynamic memory allocation algorithms and page replacement algorithms.

## üöÄ Features

### Dynamic Memory Allocation
- **First Fit Algorithm**: Allocates the first available memory block that is large enough
- **Best Fit Algorithm**: Allocates the smallest available block that is large enough
- **Worst Fit Algorithm**: Allocates the largest available block
- **Next Fit Algorithm**: Similar to First Fit but starts searching from the last allocated position

### Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**: Replaces the oldest page in memory
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Replaces the page that has been used least frequently
- **Optimal Algorithm**: Replaces the page that will be used furthest in the future (theoretical optimal)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Memory Allocation Algorithms

#### First Fit
```javascript
// Searches for the first block that can accommodate the process
for (var j = 0; j < availableBlocks.length; j++) {
    if (availableBlocks[j] >= processes[i]) {
        allocation[i] = j;
        break;
    }
}
```

#### Best Fit
```javascript
// Finds the smallest block that can accommodate the process
for (var j = 0; j < availableBlocks.length; j++) {
    if (availableBlocks[j] >= processes[i] && 
        availableBlocks[j] - processes[i] < bestFitSize) {
        bestBlockIdx = j;
        bestFitSize = availableBlocks[j] - processes[i];
    }
}
```

#### Worst Fit
```javascript
// Finds the largest available block
if (availableBlocks[j] >= processes[i] && 
    (worstBlockIdx === -1 || availableBlocks[j] > availableBlocks[worstBlockIdx])) {
    worstBlockIdx = j;
}
```

#### Next Fit
```javascript
// Starts searching from the last allocated position
var startBlockIdx = (lastBlockIdx + 1) % availableBlocks.length;
```

### Page Replacement Algorithms

#### FIFO Implementation
- Uses a circular queue approach
- Tracks position for next replacement
- Simple and efficient for basic scenarios

#### LFU Implementation
- Tracks frequency of page usage
- Replaces least frequently used page
- More complex but better for certain access patterns

#### Optimal Implementation
- Uses future knowledge of page references
- Replaces page that will be used furthest in future
- Theoretical upper bound for algorithm comparison

## üìä Fragmentation Analysis

The system calculates and displays:

- **Internal Fragmentation**: Wasted space within allocated blocks
- **External Fragmentation**: Total size of unallocated processes due to fragmentation

## üé® User Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Interactive Forms**: Dynamic input fields based on user selections
- **Visual Results**: Tables and visual blocks showing allocation results
- **Modern Styling**: Clean, professional interface with hover effects

## üß™ Educational Value
